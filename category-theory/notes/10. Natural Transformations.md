Natural Transformations
=======================

Natural transformations are mappings between functors. At this point we see functors as objects in a functor category and natural transformations as morphisms between functor objects.

If we have a category `C` containing the morphism `a -> b` and two functors `F` and `G` mapping `C` to another category `D`, then a natural transformation `alpha` will look like this:

In other words, a natural transformation exists if there is a mapping between two functors and such a mapping creates the *naturality condition*: 𝐺𝑓 ∘ 𝛼<sub>a</sub> = 𝛼<sub>b</sub> ∘ 𝐹 𝑓

The importance of natural transformations is that they make functors composable and allow us to go from `F a` to `G b` using two different paths:
1. We can apply `f` and then repackage `F` as `G` using `alpha` (𝛼<sub>b</sub> ∘ 𝐹 𝑓)
2. Or we can repackage `F` as `G` using `alpha` and then apply `f` (𝐺𝑓 ∘ 𝛼<sub>a</sub>)

In Haskell any polymorphic function that maps two functors is a natural transformation:
```haskell
alpha :: F a -> G a
```

And the naturality condition looks like:
```haskell
fmap f . alpha = alpha . fmap f
```


Functor Category
----------------
In this category the identity morphism is the natural transformation `id :: Fa -> Fa` and the  natural transformations can compose either vertically or horizontally.

### Vertical Composition
Compose functors that map objects between the same categories (e.g C -> D):

βa ∘ αa :: F a -> H a

### Horizontal Composition
Compose functors that map objects between different categories (e.g. C -> D -> E):

β ∘ α :: G ∘ F -> G'∘ F'

Challenges
----------
#### 1. Define a natural transformation from the `Maybe` functor to the `List` functor. Prove the naturality condition for it.

```haskell
-- Natural transformation
toList :: Maybe a -> List a
toList Nothing = []
toList (Just x) = [x]

-- Naturality condition for Nothing
fmap f (toList Nothing) = fmap f [] = []
toList (fmap f Nothing) = toList Nothing = []

-- Naturality condition for Just
fmap f (toList (Just x)) = fmap f [x] = [f x]
toList (fmap f (Just x)) = toList (Just (f x)) = [f x]

```

#### 2. Define at least two different natural transformations between `Reader ()` and the `List` functor. How many different lists of `()` are there?
```haskell
alpha :: Reader () a -> List a

dumb (Reader _) = []
singleton (Reader g) = [g ()]
tuple (Reader g) = [g (), g ()]
...
infinite (Reader g) = [g (), g (), ...]
```
There are infinite lists of unit.

#### 3. Continue the previous exercise with `Reader Bool` and `Maybe`.
```haskell
alpha :: Reader Bool a -> Maybe a

dumb (Reader _) = Nothing
fromFalse (Reader g) = Just (g False)
fromTrue (Reader g) = Just (g True)
```
There are 3 different maybes of bool.
