Kleisli Categories
==================

A Kleisli category is an abstraction of composition between functions that decorate their return values with some kind of context.

![Kleisli Catgory](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7043153/114642755-75356280-9ca2-11eb-8a8f-c04336e49d2a.png)

Kleisli categories have programming data types as objects (Hask objects) and morphisms between types `A` and `B` are functions that map `A` to a type `mB` that derives from `B`. These functions are also known as *Kleisly arrows*.

In this category identity is given by a function called *return* that maps any generic type `a` to the same type decorated with some context `m`:
```haskell
return :: a -> ma
```

And composition is a function called *fish operator (>=>)* that chains two Kleisli arrows:
```haskell
>=> :: (a -> mb) -> (b -> mc) -> (a -> mc)
```


Importance
----------
Kleisli categories are a functional approach to side effects. Using Kleisli arrows a programmer can perform an operation and return a result with an *extra* payload that can be composed with other Kleisli arrows, achieving kind of a composable side effect.

Kleisli categories are based on *Monads* and without them side effects couldn't be encapsulated using pure functions.
