Function Types
==============

A function type `a -> b` is a set of morphisms between objects `a` and `b`, also called a *Hom-set*.

Universal Construction
----------------------
In the Set category function types are just another set. If we take an element `f` from a set of functions `z` and combine (or pair) it with an element `x` from its input set `a`, then we obtain `f x` which is an element of its output set `b`:

If we translate this pattern into category objects, we can see an object `z` that is combined using cartesian product with an object `a` to create a new object `z * a`, which is then mapped by the morphism `g` into the object `b`:

Then, to demonstrate that these objects and morphisms are the best candidates to construct a function object, we can compare them with a similar pattern and establish a ranking:

Finally, we can rename some elements and get the universal construction of a function object:

### Formal definition
A function object from `a` to `b` is an object `a -> b` together with the morphism
```haskell
eval :: ((a -> b), a) -> b
```

such that for any other object `z` with a morphism
```haskell
g :: (z, a) -> b
```

there is a unique morphism
```haskell
h :: z -> (a -> b)
```

that factors `g` through `eval`:
```haskell
g = eval . (h , id)
```


Currying
--------
In the universal construction we can observe that `h` and `g` are equivalent functions that produce a `b`, this equivalence is known as *currying*.
```haskell
g ≡ h
(z, a) -> b ≡ z -> a -> b
```
In other words, a function with two parameters is equivalent to a function that returns another function.


Functions as Algebraic Data Types
---------------------------------
Functions are data type constructors similar to sum and product, they combine input and output types to create a new type that encapsulates a set of morphisms.

It turns out that functions, as shown below, are isomorphic to iterated products and are also expressed as exponentials where the argument is the exponent and the result is the base:

> a -> b ≡ (b, b, ..., b) ≡ b<sup>a</sup>

This expression of functions as exponents extends the algebra of sum and product types and also creates an equivalence between the worlds of numbers and types:

| Numbers                                             | Types                              |
|---------------------------------------------------- |----------------------------------- |
| 1<sup>a</sup> = 1                                   | a -> () ≡ () ≡ unit                |
| a<sup>0</sup> = 1                                   | Void -> a ≡ () ≡ absurd            |
| a<sup>1</sup> = a                                   | () -> a ≡ a                        |
| a<sup>2</sup> = a * a                               | Bool -> a ≡ (a, a)                 |
| a<sup>b + c</sup> = a<sup>b</sup> * a<sup>c</sup>   | Either b c -> a ≡ (b -> a, c -> a) |
| (a<sup>b</sup>)<sup>c</sup> = a<sup>b * c</sup>     | c -> b -> a ≡ (b, c) -> a          |
| (a * b)<sup>c</sup> = a<sup>c</sup> * b<sup>c</sup> | c -> (a, b) ≡ (c -> a, c -> b)     |


Curry-Howard Isomorphism
------------------------
Functions have their equivalence in the logic world where they are know as implications.

> If `a` then `b`: a &rArr; b ≡ a -> b

According to the Curry-Howard isomorphism, every type can be interpreted as a proposition and propositions are considered true if the type is inhabited and false otherwise. When we implement a function we prove that a proposition (implication) is true.


Cartesian Categories
--------------------
### Cartesian Category
A category that has terminal and product objects

### Cartesian Closed Category
A category that has terminal, product and exponential objects

### Bicartesian Closed Category
A category that has initial, sum, terminal, product and exponential objects
